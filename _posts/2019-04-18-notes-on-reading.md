Part of the scope of this project is that the student gets in touch with deep learning concepts, given the experience on the subject was a couple of class projects on artificial intelligence. 

The main text book chosen for this was [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by author Michael A. Nielsen, and it was read during the first few weeks of the project's execution. 

Here in this post there are going to be all the student's personal notes on the subject as a way of docummentation for future reference on the project or personal studies.
