While I document my notes on reading, I have already begun following the basic keras usage tutorials available at [Deep learning with python Notebooks](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks/). Is is also based on a book with the same title and this should be an interesting extra reading material. 

The first tutorial is to create a simple neural network and use it on the MNIST database. 

I will be posting all my work on [this github repository](https://github.com/LucianaMarques/simpleCNN/), which will be basically reproducing the tutorials, but I might as well make some modifications or personal notes on the work I get done.
